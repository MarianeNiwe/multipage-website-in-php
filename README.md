## About the Project 

This project will helps us to learn how to realise a project in real situations, but will not be given to a any client. It is just an exercise from [BeCode](https://github.com/becodeorg/lovelace-2/tree/master/Projects/multipage-website-in-php)
For this, we have to refresh an existing [website](http://www.abpasbl.be/-AMV-asbl-Bruxelles-), with several pages to separate the content and that the visitors to the website can send an email via a contact form with a small photo.

## Client

[**ABP - `Association Belge des Paralys√©s`**](http://www.abpasbl.be/-AMV-asbl-Bruxelles-)

## Objectives

The objective of this challenge is to give us the opportunity to use our new knowledge in PHP in a realistic scenario. It is therefore more important that each member of our team achieves her learning objectives than to succeed in the project.

## Instructions

We had at our disposal the [briefing](https://github.com/becodeorg/Johnson2/tree/master/projets/multipage-website-in-php) to realise this project.
